# Emulating-On-Road-Operating-Conditions-for-Electric-Drive-Propulsion-Systems
The effect of total vehicle inertia is considered   and a control scheme is developed based on vehicle equivalent rotational inertia
Control scheme is developed considering on road conditions and simulted using MATLAB simulink
